  <strong>Hi there!</strong>
</p>

I’m **Stelios Zacharioudakis**, a third-year Computer Science student at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and Head Engineer at the Medical Association of Paphos.

I architect and maintain the Association’s web & backend systems, and have built custom websites for medical professionals and university professors. My work focuses on delivering intuitive, secure, and scalable solutions that streamline healthcare workflows.

Outside of my day-to-day, I’m passionate about exploring new web technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and crafting user-centric interfaces. In my free time I enjoy designing side projects, gaming, and diving into the latest developments in software engineering.
